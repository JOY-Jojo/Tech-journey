            I started my tech journey in 2022 during a long break I had in
            school. My tech journey began with curiosity and a willingness to
            learn, fueled by a passion for innovation and problem-solving. From
            exploring the basics of coding to diving into web development, I've
            navigated various fields, embracing challenges and celebrating
            milestones. Along the way, I've discovered a love for front-end
            development. With each new skill and project, my excitement grows,
            and I'm eager to see where this journey takes me â€“ whether it's
            building impactful solutions, collaborating with like-minded
            individuals, or pushing the boundaries of what's possible with
            technology.

            As a beginner, I've faced challenges like understanding complex
            coding concepts, troubleshooting errors, and staying motivated. Some
            specific hurdles included grasping basic syntax, managing coding
            frustration, and finding reliable resources. However, with
            persistence and practice, I've overcome these obstacles and grown
            more confident in my abilities."
